# rom-organizers
A collection of rom organization tools, currently only consisting of a PS1 rom organizer that sorts the roms into folders and creates m3u files to reference in the emulator.

Future projects:
* upgrading the ps1 organizer to become a general disc organizer
* adding clean up utilities to remove orphaned files and folders
* duplicate rom finder and remover
* general rom organizer for all consoles (drop files and click to organize)
